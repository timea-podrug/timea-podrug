        <h3>My Coding Journey</h3>
    </summary>
    During my time in middle school, I stumbled upon the enchanting world of coding and instantly fell in love with it. Determined to pursue my passion, I enrolled in a high school specializing in web development.

Eager to connect with like-minded individuals, I began attending local IT community events, such as meetups and workshops. The Festival of Entrepreneurship and Technology caught my attention, and I eagerly volunteered to be a part of it. The experience was exhilarating, and I was grateful for the opportunity to contribute.

Recognizing my dedication, Split Tech City, a respected organization in our community, approached me and two of my friends. They entrusted us with the task of organizing a conference called NEXT. We poured our hearts into planning the event, from inviting speakers to handling logistics and promotions.

When the day of the NEXT conference arrived, the atmosphere buzzed with excitement. Tech enthusiasts, entrepreneurs, and industry professionals gathered, and I felt a mix of nervousness and pride as the organizer. Witnessing the connections made and the inspiration sparked among attendees was truly rewarding.

The success of the NEXT conference marked a significant milestone in my coding journey. It reinforced my passion for coding and showed me the power of community and knowledge sharing.

Looking back, I realize that my love for coding goes beyond writing code or completing projects. It's about the connections I've made, the knowledge I've gained, and the impact I can have on the ever-evolving world of technology. With each step forward, I'm excited to continue learning and making a difference in the field I'm so passionate about.
